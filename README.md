# Harvard's CS50 Web programming with Python and Javascript
## Project 0

Hello! This is my project 0 for Harvard's CS50 W. 

In this project you'll find somewhat like a copy of some of Google's pages:

- Inside [index.html](https://github.com/gbrandao-creator/CS50-Web/blob/project0/index.html), there's a page destined for regular Google Search, with a "I'm feeling lucky" button and links to the other two pages.
- Inside [images.html](https://github.com/gbrandao-creator/CS50-Web/blob/project0/images.html), there's a page destined for Google Images Search.
- Inside [advanced-search.html](https://github.com/gbrandao-creator/CS50-Web/blob/project0/advanced-search.html), there's a page for Google's Advanced Search, with only 4 input fields.
- The styles are all contained in [styles.css](https://github.com/gbrandao-creator/CS50-Web/blob/project0/styles.css).
