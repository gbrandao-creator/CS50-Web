# Harvard's CS50 Web programming with Python and Javascript
## Project 0

Hello! This is my project 0 for Harvard's CS50 W. 

In this project you'll find somewhat like a copy of some of Google's pages:

- Inside index.html, there's a page destined for regular Google Search, with a "I'm feeling lucky" button and links to the other two pages.
- Inside images.html, there's a page destined for Google Images Search.
- Inside advanced-search.html, there's a page for Google's Advanced Search, with only 4 input fields.
- The styles are all contained in styles.css.

:)
